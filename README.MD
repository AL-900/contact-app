# Project Name

Contact App .

# ---Description about this project ---

this is a project made with ReactJs, redux , NodeJs and Webpack .

This is a simple contact app , which can add new contact , edit any contact from contact list and also can delete any contact from contact list .

If you try to add or edit any contact it'll check is that phone number or e-mail address is exist already ! that means you cann't add same email and phone number more than once .

This is my first redux project . it's a very simple project I didn't need use redux... I had a better option
that is React Context API , for learning reason I use redux .

You can add or delete as much contact as you wish but if you refresh the page you'll lost all contacts  beacuse it's not connected
 with database .
